# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-for-Smart-Buildings
This project would create models to predict energy usage in buildings based on historical consumption patterns, weather data, and occupancy information.

Key Components:

Time series data preprocessing including handling seasonality and trends
Feature engineering incorporating calendar effects and external variables
Implementation of ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize prediction accuracy
Multi-step forecasting for different time horizons
Evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
Applications in energy optimization and demand response
